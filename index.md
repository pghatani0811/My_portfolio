# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Examining-the-effect-of-environmental-factors-and-weather-on-demand-of-Bike-rentals)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**55%** accuracy](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Examining-the-effect-of-environmental-factors-and-weather-on-demand-of-Bike-rentals).

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Fit a Linear regression with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Portu Bank Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Portu_Bank-Marketing_Anlysis)

<img src="images/bank.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**87%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Portu_Bank-Marketing_Anlysis).

- Used logistic regression to to classify whether term deposit is subscribed or not.
- Classified subscription depending on selected important features.
- Explored a machine learning approach to marketing analysis.

[Orthopedic Patients Presiction](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Orthopedic_Patients_Prediction)

<img src="images/OP.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters according to that I classified whether the patients are Normal or Abnormal.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify whether client has subscribed the term deposit or not [**75%** accuracy using Logistic Regression algorithm](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Orthopedic_Patients_Prediction).

- Used K-Nearest-Neighbors and GaussianNB to classify Normal or Abnormal paitents.
- Analysed different parameters to classify patients.
- Explored a machine learning approach to Medical Analysis.

[Employee Compensation](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Employee_Compensation)

<img src="images/EC.webp?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Elbow, Clustering

**Project Objective:** The San Francisco Controllerâ€™s Office maintains a database of the salary and benefits, paid to City employees since fiscal year 2013. This data is summarized and presented on the Employee Compensation.

**Quantifiable result:** We could created [**3 Clusters** using K-Means algorithm](https://github.com/pghatani0811/Employee_Compensation).

- Used K-Means algorythm to create cluster depending on the Dataset.
- Used Elbow method to get the optimal number of cluster.
- Explored a Unsupervised learning approach to create data group.

[HandWritten Digits Recognition](https://github.com/pghatani0811/HandWritten_Digits_Recognition)

<img src="images/CV.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Mnist is a dataset with 70,000 of handwritten digits. Here I have predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Neural Network.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**98%** using **5** epochs](https://github.com/pghatani0811/HandWritten_Digits_Recognition).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of Mnist data
- Data Source: MNIST
